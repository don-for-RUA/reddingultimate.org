* Use bootstrap breadcrumbs
* Break out parts of page.haml into partials
* Use more bootstrap on the sidebar (can we change the 'current' class to 'active')?

* Remove span4 on the text on the 404 page...maybe offset, though?
* Add a 'draft' notice on the top of drafts in development
* Convert TODO to issues
