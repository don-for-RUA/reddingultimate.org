# About us

The Redding Ultimate Association has been setup to help promote Ultimate throughout the Redding area.
We will be researching what is needed to get grants and corporate donations to help fund our efforts.
We are currently registered as a corporation in the state of California.

This group contributes to Redding Ultimate play such as pickup play, city recreation leagues, RUA sponsored leagues, school teams, and club teams (such as the Red Hots).

For more information about RUA, or to get involved, please [contact us](/contact).
