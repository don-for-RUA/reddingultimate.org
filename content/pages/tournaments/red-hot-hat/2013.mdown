The 2013 Red Hot Hat tournament will be held on Saturday, April 27th at [Enterprise Park](/places/enterprise), starting at 8:30am.

Day-of registration is $25.
We hope to see you there!

The Red Hot Hat is a open-to-the-public hat tournament.
You don't need to come with a team &mdash; just bring yourself, and we will put together random yet balanced teams the morning of the tournament!
The tournament starts at 8:30am and will run through the afternoon until 4pm or 5pm.

We will provide a guaranteed four games, food, hydration, and basic amenities.
Pre-registration <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Hs6b0YoJ9UQpZdd_aga6Vi3tEuhueYNhRaq9JS61Ccg/viewform" target="_blank">is open</a> (link will open in a new window), and you will be presented with a link to pay after you submit the form.
You're welcome to indicate your intention to attend on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/148400795324397/), but you will *not* be registered unless you complete our registration form and pay.

All updates and new information will be posted to this page, as well as our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReddingUltimateAssociation/) and [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/redding-ultimate-association).
We can't wait to see you at the tournament on April 27th!

Some miscellany:

* This year's theme is [cryptozoology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology); each team will be themed after a different epic creature.
* We hope to have discs for purchase at the fields; once we are sure the order is on time we will make the discs available for pre-order here on the website.
* Even if you pre-register, you will need to sign a waiver when you get to the fields. If you are under 18, you will need a parent or guardian present to sign the waiver with you.
* While we encourage revelry and good times in every form, alcohol is not allowed at the fields.
