# Leagues

Throughout the year, the Redding Ultimate Association organizes a summer and fall leagues for the local ultimate community.
These leagues are intended to provide a place where new and old players alike can play together in a structured, fun, competitive environment and where everyone can learn the game and practice new skills.

For more information about our summer and fall leagues, see their specific pages, linked to below.
