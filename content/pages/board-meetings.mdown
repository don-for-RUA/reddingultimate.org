# RUA Board Meetings

Once a month the Redding Ultimate Association holds a board meeting to discuss ongoing events and plan events for the future.
These meetings are open to the public, and all are welcome.
Please contact our Vice President at <vp@reddingultimate.org> for more information about attending board meetings and getting involved.

Our minutes from the past few months are posted here and are open and available to the public.
Earlier months are available by request from <vp@reddingultimate.org>.
