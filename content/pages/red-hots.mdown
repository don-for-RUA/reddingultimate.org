# Red Hots

The Redding Red Hots is a mixed-gender, tournament-only club team that pulls players from all over the North State area.
Though we don't practice often, we can throw together some nasty lines of solid veteran players and young whippersnappers to make your hair stand on end.
Plus, we will definitely make a strong bid for winning the party.
If you are interested in playing some fun, chill, medium-level club ultimate, or just want to find out more about tournament play, email us at <redhots@reddingultimate.org>.
