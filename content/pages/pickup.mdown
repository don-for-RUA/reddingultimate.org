The Redding area has a variety of pickup options for interested players,
at a variety of levels. We aim to keep this page as up-to-date as possible,
but there's always a chance that a given pickup game has changed date,
time, or location. Contact the organizer of the pickup game before heading
out for the first time.

If you have information about any new pickup games, or if you notice
someting wrong with the information we have here, send us a line at
<a href="mailto:pickup@reddingultimate.org">pickup@reddingultimate.org</a> and we'll set it right.
